All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)

### Changed

- EVE/UTC tz handling optimized


### [1.5.0] - 2021-01-25

  of their alts up and running
- More ESI error handling


### [1.4.5] - 2021-01-20

### Changed

  the "old" ESI link was not closed.


## [1.4.4] - 2021-01-11

### Added

- Option to set the default expiry time for clickable FAT links in minutes. If
  nothing es set, 60 minutes will be assumed as default.

## Changed

- Permissions have been completely overhauled and simplified

  | Name | Description | Notes |
  |:-----|:------------|:-----|
  | basic_access | Can access the AFAT module | Your line member probably want this permission, so they can see the module and click the FAT links they are given. They also can see their own statistics with this permission. |
  | manage_afat | Can manage the AFAT module | Your Military lead probably should get this permission |
  | add_fatlink | Can create FAT Links | Your regular FC or who ever should be able to add FAT links should have this permission |
  | stats_corporation_own | Can see own corporation statistics |  |
  | stats_corporation_other | Can see statistics of other corporations |  |

  **Please make sure to read the following before updating!**

  Permissions have been completely redone and simplified. This means, the current
  permissions will no longer apply after the update. Time to clean them up! In order
  to do so, run the following commands **in exactly this order!**

  - _Update the software itself:_
    ```shell
    pip install -u allianceauth-afat
    ```

  - _Open a django console:_
    ```shell
    python manage.py shell
    ```

  - _Remove the modules old permissions:_
    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth.models import Permission
    Permission.objects.filter(content_type__app_label="afat").delete()
    exit()
    ```

  - _Run static collection and migrations:_
    ```shell
    python manage.py collectstatic
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

  **Keep in mind, you have to set the new permission to the state/grous that
  previously had permissions.**


## [1.4.3] - 2021-01-08

### Fixed

- Deal with invalid user profiles. For example when a user has revoked his/her ESI
  access.


## [1.4.2] - 2021-01-07

### Added

- Useragent to ESI calls

### Changed

- Ajax URLs structured
- Internal methods for afat_view renamed to dashboard
- Views modularized
- Dashboard static tables replaced with DataTables which get populated via Ajax calls
- Fleet Edit FAT list table replaced with DataTable
- Statistics now only show alliances and corps when their members have access to the
  module, not just all anymore

### Fixed

- Missing fleet commander added to ESI FAT links. Now the automatic ESI pull also
  works when the fleet commander is an alt of the creator
- Length of form fields adjusted
- Hardened the auto ESI pull against possible ESI hiccups, so ESI FAT links are not
  closed prematurely


## [1.4.1] - 2020-12-24

### Added

- Explanation for the "via Esi" labels in FAT list view
- New "via Esi" label for currently active ESI links


### Fixed

- Prevent user from opening more than 1 ESI fleet


## [1.4.0] - 2020-12-24

### New

ESI links will now be updated automagically. This means, pilots who join later will
still be registered, as long as the FC who created the ESI link is still the actual
fleet boss and didn't close or leave the fleet.


## [1.3.4] - 2020-12-16

### Fixed

- Bootstrap classes in template


## [1.3.3] - 2020-11-28

### Changed
- Reducing characters displayed on stats main view to only those with FATs

### Fixed
- 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'character_name'
  (This happens when the creator of a FAT link for what ever reason lost his main char
  and prevents the FAT link list from being loaded.)


## [1.3.2] - 2020-11-23

### Changed
- couple of tweaks to templates and JS
- show only characters with FAT links in stats main view


## [1.3.1] - 2020-11-22

### Changed
- tables tweaked â€¦
    - preventing DataTables from getting wider than their parent element
    - even/odd styles
    - text alignments


## [1.3.0] - 2020-11-19

### New Feature
- Import scripts for imports from Alliance Auth's FAT module as well as from bFAT
  and ImicusFAT. These imports can be done initially right after the first install of
  AFAT. Fiddling around with SQL to import is no linger needed with this.

### Added
- Filter to the Fat Links List view. You can now filter for Fleet Type and is a
  FAT link was created via ESI or not in the FAT links list.

### Changed
- FAT links information in FAT links list is now loaded via ajax. This means, especially
  for installations with a large number of FAT links, this page should be loaded considerably faster.
- Minimum required version of Alliance Auth set to 2.8.0

### Removed
- Support for Django 2


## [1.2.0] - 2020-10-19

### New
- Added a check to `Clickable FATLinks` to verify whether the character is
  actually online.

### Changed
- Workflow improvements for `ESI FATLinks`
- Show only chars with recent activity in "Recent Activity" view

### Fixed
- Added Average FATs to the monthly corp stats overview.
- Added "Basic Access" permission. This permission prevents unintended audience
  from accessing the module.

### Updating
**IMPORTANT**:
When updating to this version, you will need to give the state/group that should have
access to the AFAT module the
`afat|Alliance Auth AFAT|Can access the Alliance Auth AFAT module` permission.
Without this permission, the user cannot see the link, open any statistics or register
via clickable FATLinks.

To update your existing installation of AFAT, first enable your virtual environment
(venv) of your Alliance Auth installation.

```bash
pip install -U allianceauth-afat

python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py migrate
```

Finally restart your supervisor services for AA
