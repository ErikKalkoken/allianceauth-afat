All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## [1.3.3] - 2020-11-28

### Fixed
- 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'character_name' (This happens when the creator of a FAT link for what ever reason lost his main char and prevents the FAT link list from being loaded.)

### Changed
- Reducing characters displayed on stats main view to only those with FATs


## [1.3.2] - 2020-11-23

### Changed
- couple of tweaks to templates and JS
- show only characters with FAT links in stats main view


## [1.3.1] - 2020-11-22

### Changed
- tables tweaked â€¦
    - preventing DataTables from getting wider than their parent element
    - even/odd styles
    - text alignments


## [1.3.0] - 2020-11-19

### New Feature
- Import scripts for imports from Alliance Auth's FAT module as well as from bFAT and ImicusFAT. These imports can be done initially right after the first install of AFAT. Fiddling around with SQL to import is no linger needed with this.

### Added
- Filter to the Fat Links List view. You can now filter for Fleet Type and is a FAT link was created via ESI or not in the FAT links list.

### Changed
- FAT links information in FAT links list is now loaded via ajax. This means, especially for installations with a large number of FAT links, this page should be loaded considerably faster.
- Minimum required version of Alliance Auth set to 2.8.0

### Removed
- Support for Django 2


## [1.2.0] - 2020-10-19

### New
- Added a check to `Clickable FATLinks` to verify whether the character is actually online.

### Changed
- Workflow improvements for `ESI FATLinks`
- Show only chars with recent activity in "Recent Activity" view

### Fixed
- Added Average FATs to the monthly corp stats overview.
- Added "Basic Access" permission. This permission prevents unintended audience from accessing the module.

### Updating
**IMPORTANT**:
When updating to this version, you will need to give the state/group that should have access to the AFAT module the `afat|Alliance Auth AFAT|Can access the Alliance Auth AFAT module` permission. Without this permission, the user cannot see the link, open any statistics or register via clickable FATLinks.

To update your existing installation of AFAT, first enable your virtual environment (venv) of your Alliance Auth installation.

```bash
pip install -U allianceauth-afat

python manage.py collectstatic
python manage.py migrate
```

Finally restart your supervisor services for AA
